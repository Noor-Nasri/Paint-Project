# Paint-Project
This is the paint program made by me for a school project. Made in python and converted to an .exe file to run without installing python.

How to set up:
 Step 1: Download the paint program (.exe file) and the folders required (compressed together as .rar) in the same folder
 Step 2: Decompress the compressed file (Make sure that the folders created are in the same file as the program)
 Step 3: You should now have a folder with the .exe program, and the following files: GIF Frames, Images, Saves, Stamps. It should also include the Gusty Garden Galaxy - Super Mario Galaxy.mp3. If you have all of those under the same folder, running the Paint Project.exe should work
 Step 4: Enjoy!
 
Extra Notes:
  Thank you for downloading my paint program. The goal was to create a simple paint project, I pushed my abilities and made this. Unfortunately, I had to do other things, and was unable to finish the game portion of my paint program within the week I was working on this project.

This was made with python, using the following modules: 
os, time, random, functools, math, pygame, requests

This program was then changed from a .py to a .exe using pyinstaller.
